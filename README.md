## Deployment

This site is currently deployed via Netlify from the master branch.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/518285fa-ae52-4f5e-95c9-0f69138ed443/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/greater-boston-anti-displacement-toolkit/deploys)

## Translations & Toolkit Contents

Translations of shorter string snippets are stored in the `/src/locales/en.json` and `/src/locales/es.json` files. Each toolkit also has an corresponding object in the translations file with its title, header question, header image, links to google doc & pdfs, etc.

Full toolkit content in long-form is written out in the `/src/components/Toolkit_en` and `/src/components/Toolkit_es` folders. To make updates to toolkit contents, check these folders first. At build time, the `/src/views/Toolkit/*.vue` files dynamically load the corresponding English or Spanish toolkit component and populate metadata from the translation files in the `toolkit` object.
