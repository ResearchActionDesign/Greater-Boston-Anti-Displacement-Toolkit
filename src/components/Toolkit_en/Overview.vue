      <h2>Purpose, Values & Goals</h2>
      <p>This multi-media organizing toolkit is a collection of activities, how-to guides, facilitation plans, and resources that organizers and residents can use to fight displacement in their communities.</p>
        <p>Chelsea and Everett, Massachusetts are facing pressure from developers, resulting in land being swallowed up by investors and increased housing prices, and the forced displacement (or pushing-out) of residents and small businesses. These two communities have been involved in the Healthy Neighborhoods Study (HNS), a participatory action research project which aims to understand the relationship between development, neighborhood conditions, and health across nine communities in Massachusetts. Documented research from 2016-2019 indicates that 40% of Chelsea and 31% of Everett survey respondents expect to move in the next five years; of that research, 72% of Chelsea and 75% of Everett respondents indicated that they are proud to live in their community. However, the impact of displacement will negatively affect these respondents, other individuals, families, and communities. To learn more about displacement, including its impact on health, educational outcomes, and community power, view <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/pushedout">Pushed Out</a>, a short video produced by Urban Displacement Project.</p>
      <p>Ensuring that our communities remain viable options in which residents can live and thrive is within our power. As we face continued large-scale developments and planning initiatives such as the East Boston Master Plan, the Chelsea Creek Municipal Harbor Plan, or the Encore Casino in Everett, it's important and timely for the local community to address displacement.</p>
      <p>We wanted to create a guide for community members to work together to protect and preserve their communities. Our goal is for you, the user, to build power through collective analysis (from your own knowledge), create shared goals and actions, and develop guiding principles of equitable development.</p>

      <h2>How to use this Toolkit to fight displacement in Greater Boston</h2>
      <p>As communities protect themselves and organize against displacement, this toolkit can be a resource for residents working together to create change. Communities most vulnerable to displacement are the most in touch with what is happening on the ground, and know which solutions will work best for themselves. This toolkit will help residents, neighborhood councils, organizations, and anyone organizing against displacement engage with each other in meaningful ways. Whether a community is trying to further understand how displacement shows up, create awareness among allies, or push for specific policy and programmatic solutions, this toolkit can help. It can be used to build power within residents, as well as push for concrete changes within the community. Through the use of data and stories, it touches the minds and hearts of those who care deeply about their community and can implement change.</p>
      <p>This toolkit can be used by anyone wanting to work with others to fight displacement in their community, no matter their organizing experience. With easy-to-read, translatable, and accessible facilitation guides—whether you’re an experienced organizer, a service provider, a tenant or a homeowner, a life-long resident or newly arrived—this toolkit is for you and your community!</p>
      <p>Protection of residents and local business, production of affordable housing, and preservation of existing affordable housing stock are all key pieces of preventing displacement. Multiple possibilities lie in actions that can and should be taken—there is no one-size-fits-all solution. A community’s wants and needs must come from the ground up—and we hope this toolkit will help you get there!</p>
      <h2>Who was involved in creating this Anti-Displacement Toolkit?</h2>
      <p>This toolkit was made possible by the contributions of many organizations and community members, whom we thank for sharing their time, expertise, and commitment.</p>

      <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
      <p>This toolkit is a co-design project. In the first year of its development, community partner organizations identified, shared, and prioritized the problems, audiences, and potential tools needed to help influence change in their communities. In April 2018, the partners agreed upon a shared problem statement for the project: “We want people to be able to stay in their communities safely, affordably, and healthily. We want people to have a voice in shaping place. This is not currently happening in the communities of Chelsea, Everett, and East Boston.”</p>
      <p>Based on the problem statement, the community-partner organizations agreed on developing a multimedia organizing toolkit. The co-design process included reviewing existing toolkits and resources, developing the outline and components of the toolkit; co-creating the story and script for the film; and drafting, gathering, and reviewing content for each of the components. In March 2019, a co-design session was held to engage community-partner organizations and their community members and networks in the design and testing of the toolkit. The two-day co-design session and debrief consisted of conducting two idea labs to shape and generate content, three test labs to refine select components of the toolkit, and a small group screening and final review of the film cut. The feedback and evaluations from the co-design session were used to refine and finalize the multimedia organizing toolkit to fight displacement.</p>
