    "title": "WHY A DISPLACEMENT TOOLKIT FOR GREATER BOSTON?",
    "summary": "Our communities (Chelsea and Everett, MA) are facing a lot of pressure from developers, which has resulted in land being lost, housing prices and rent increasing, forcing residents and small businesses to be pushed out, or displaced. Displacement has many negative effects on individuals, families and communities. See here for a short video on some of these, including impacts on health, educational outcomes, and community power. We wanted to create a guide for community members to work together to protect & preserve their communities."
